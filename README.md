# Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
In mathematics, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all primes smaller than n when n is smaller than 10 million or so.
Time complexity : O(n*log(log(n)))

NOTES:-
memset in C++
Converts the value ch to unsigned char and copies it into each of the first n characters of the object pointed to by str[]. If the object is not trivially-copyable (e.g., scalar, array, or a C-compatible struct), the behavior is undefined. If n is greater than the size of the object pointed to by str, the behavior is undefined.
